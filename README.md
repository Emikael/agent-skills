# e6-agent-skills

**Production-grade engineering skills for AI coding agents.**

26 skills guide AI agents from feature context and acceptance criteria through implementation, tests, local runtime checks, review, and handoff. One coordinator loads specialists as needed; `e6-caveman` keeps communication concise.

![e6-agent-skills: one coordinator connects Understand, Plan, Build, Verify, Review, and Handoff, supported by context on demand and concise communication](docs/images/e6-agent-skills.png)

**Workflow:** Understand → Plan → Build → Verify → Review → Handoff.

Implementation requests continue through the applicable phases within existing authorization. Plan-only, review-only, and test-only requests keep their scope. Commits and releases follow user authorization and project rules. See the [workflow contract](references/workflow-contract.md).

## Commands

Nine lifecycle command wrappers are provided for Claude Code and Gemini CLI. Other hosts expose the underlying skills or need their own aliases; Antigravity wrapper availability depends on its version. The table shows short names; Claude plugin commands use a namespace such as `/e6-agent-skills:build`. Gemini names its planning wrapper `/planning`. See the setup guides below.

| What you're doing | Command | Key principle |
|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| Define what to build | `/spec` | Spec before code |
| Plan how to build it | `/plan` | Small, verifiable vertical slices |
| Build incrementally | `/build` or `/build auto` | Next task or whole requested plan |
| Prove it works | `/test` | Meaningful tests and runtime evidence |
| Set the quality bar | `/constraints` | Prove that exceeded thresholds fail |
| Review before merge | `/review` | Improve code health |
| Audit web performance | `/webperf` | Measure before you optimize |
| Simplify the code | `/code-simplify` | Clarity over cleverness |
| Prepare or perform a release | `/ship` | Verified candidate, recovery, and authorization |

Want the whole workflow from one request? Install the complete pack and [activate the coordinator](docs/workflow-activation.md). `using-e6-agent-skills` gathers context, defines criteria, plans, builds with tests, runs locally, reviews, and hands off. `/build auto` completes the whole requested plan using existing authorization; commits and releases follow project rules and user scope.

See the [SDLC workflow change report](docs/sdlc-workflow-report.md) for the audit, implemented improvements, and verification limits.

The Claude plugin registers a compact startup bootstrap. Other hosts can use the idempotent project-rule installer. Native skill selection remains available; activation and model compliance need behavioral verification.

---

## Quick Start

**Complete workflow:** use a native whole-repository plugin below, or keep a complete clone and add a compact project bootstrap. This preserves the coordinator, specialists, shared references, and helper scripts.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Emikael/e6-agent-skills.git e6-agent-skills

# Preview project wiring; use codex, opencode, gemini, or claude for --host.
node e6-agent-skills/scripts/install-workflow-bootstrap.js \
  --project /path/to/project --pack ./e6-agent-skills --host codex

# Write the bootstrap while preserving existing project instructions.
node e6-agent-skills/scripts/install-workflow-bootstrap.js \
  --project /path/to/project --pack ./e6-agent-skills --host codex --write
```

Node.js is required for the installer and repository checks. The Claude startup hook uses Bash. See the [activation guide](docs/workflow-activation.md) for host-specific wiring and upgrade checks.

**Skill-only installation:** the open [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) supports Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, and other agents:

```bash
npx skills add Emikael/e6-agent-skills            # choose skills to install
npx skills add Emikael/e6-agent-skills --skill '*' # select all 26 skills
npx skills add Emikael/e6-agent-skills --list     # browse before installing
```

Or grab individual skills:

```bash
npx skills add Emikael/e6-agent-skills --skill e6-code-review-and-quality   # five-axis review before merge
npx skills add Emikael/e6-agent-skills --skill e6-interview-me              # requirements interrogation, one question at a time
npx skills add Emikael/e6-agent-skills --skill e6-test-driven-development   # behavioral red-green-refactor
```

> **Skill discovery and workflow activation are separate.** A skill-only install
> may omit repository-level references, scripts, hooks, and command wrappers,
> even when every skill is selected. For the complete workflow, retain the full
> pack and point the bootstrap at its root. Relative links need the original
> directory layout; copying a shared checklist into an individual skill does
> not repair those links. See [activation](docs/workflow-activation.md) and the
> [portability notes](docs/skill-anatomy.md).

Prefer a native integration? Pick your tool below.

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code (recommended)</b></summary>

**Marketplace install:**

```
/plugin marketplace add Emikael/e6-agent-skills
/plugin install e6-agent-skills@e6-agent-skills
```

Enable the plugin and start a new session to load its compact SessionStart bootstrap.

> **SSH errors?** The marketplace clones repos via SSH. If you don't have SSH keys set up on GitHub, either [add your SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) or use the full HTTPS URL to force HTTPS cloning during the marketplace-add step:
> ```bash
> /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Emikael/e6-agent-skills.git
> /plugin install e6-agent-skills@e6-agent-skills
> ```
>
> If `/plugin install` still fails with `git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey)` on Windows or macOS, the recommended workaround is to configure Git once to rewrite GitHub SSH URLs to HTTPS for subprocess clones:
> ```bash
> git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf git@github.com:
> ```

**Local / development:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Emikael/e6-agent-skills.git e6-agent-skills
claude --plugin-dir ./e6-agent-skills
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor</b></summary>

Put discovered skills under `.cursor/skills/` and a compact coordinator policy in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`. Keep the complete pack accessible for shared references and helpers. See [docs/cursor-setup.md](docs/cursor-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Antigravity CLI</b></summary>

Install as a native plugin for skills and subagents. In affected Antigravity CLI releases, legacy command TOMLs are reported as converted but their wrapper commands are not discoverable; invoke the underlying namespaced skills directly. See [docs/antigravity-setup.md](docs/antigravity-setup.md#lifecycle-workflows-and-command-compatibility).

**Install from the repo:**

```bash
agy plugin install https://github.com/Emikael/e6-agent-skills.git
```

**Install from a local clone:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Emikael/e6-agent-skills.git e6-agent-skills
agy plugin install ./e6-agent-skills
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Gemini CLI</b></summary>

Install native skills for discovery and add a compact workflow bootstrap to `GEMINI.md`. Keep full skill bodies on demand. See [docs/gemini-cli-setup.md](docs/gemini-cli-setup.md).

**Install from the repo:**

```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/Emikael/e6-agent-skills.git --path skills
```

**Install from a local clone:**

```bash
gemini skills install ./e6-agent-skills/skills/
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Windsurf</b></summary>

Add a compact coordinator rule pointing to the complete pack. Load skill bodies only as needed. See [docs/windsurf-setup.md](docs/windsurf-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>OpenCode</b></summary>

Copy skills to `.opencode/skills/` (or `~/.config/opencode/skills/`), add a project-local `AGENTS.md`, and use the built-in `skill` tool for agent-driven execution. Optional slash commands can be added under `.opencode/commands/`.

See [docs/opencode-setup.md](docs/opencode-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>GitHub Copilot</b></summary>

Install skills under `.github/skills/` and keep compact project policies in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Adapt persona filenames to `*.agent.md` under `.github/agents/`. See [docs/copilot-setup.md](docs/copilot-setup.md).

Using the standalone `copilot` CLI? Install it as a plugin — see [docs/copilot-cli-setup.md](docs/copilot-cli-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Kiro IDE & CLI </b></summary>
  Skills for Kiro reside under `.kiro/skills/` at project or global scope. Use the host's supported project rules for the compact bootstrap. See the [Kiro skills documentation](https://kiro.dev/docs/skills/).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Codex</b></summary>

Install with a Codex CLI that supports `codex plugin`:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add Emikael/e6-agent-skills
codex plugin add e6-agent-skills@e6-agent-skills
```

The first command registers the marketplace; the second installs the plugin. Codex reads the root `skills/` directory through `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. Start a new session and select a skill from the host's picker. In the CLI, explicit skill mentions use `$`; plugin skills are namespaced, for example `$e6-agent-skills:using-e6-agent-skills`. Add the compact project bootstrap for whole-workflow requests. See [docs/codex-setup.md](docs/codex-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Command Code</b></summary>

Install natively with the built-in `cmd skills` command. Command Code clones the repo, discovers every `SKILL.md`, and installs into `.commandcode/skills/`:

```bash
cmd skills add Emikael/e6-agent-skills            # pick skills to install (project)
cmd skills add Emikael/e6-agent-skills --global   # install for all projects (~/.commandcode/skills/)
cmd skills add Emikael/e6-agent-skills -s e6-spec-driven-development  # install a specific skill
```

Installed skills show up in the TUI slash menu, e.g. `/e6-spec-driven-development`. See [docs/commandcode-setup.md](docs/commandcode-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Other Agents</b></summary>

Skills are plain Markdown - they work with any agent that accepts system prompts or instruction files. See [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md).

## Adoption

Already installed? How you roll the pack out depends on your codebase. The **[Adoption Guide](docs/adoption-guide.md)** covers two paths: the full lifecycle from day one for a greenfield project, or an incremental, verification-first rollout for an established codebase.

---

## All 26 Skills

The commands above are entry points. The pack includes 26 skills total — 24 lifecycle skills, the `using-e6-agent-skills` coordinator, and `e6-caveman` for concise communication. Each skill is a structured workflow with steps, verification gates, and anti-rationalization tables. You can also reference any skill directly.

## How Skills Work

Every skill follows a consistent anatomy:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SKILL.md                                       │
│                                                 │
│  ┌─ Frontmatter ─────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ name: lowercase-hyphen-name               │  │
│  │ description: Use when [trigger].          │  │
│  │              [Concrete task vocabulary.]  │  │
│  └───────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
│  Overview         → What this skill does        │
│  When to Use      → Triggering conditions       │
│  Process          → Step-by-step workflow       │
│  Rationalizations → Excuses + rebuttals         │
│  Red Flags        → Signs something's wrong     │
│  Verification     → Evidence requirements       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key design choices:**

- **Explicit handoffs.** Specialists return evidence to one coordinator, which continues the requested workflow.
- **Anti-rationalization.** Every skill includes a table of common excuses agents use to skip steps (e.g., "I'll add tests later") with documented counter-arguments.
- **Evidence before completion.** Changed behavior needs observed RED/GREEN; refactors use characterization; prose/configuration uses relevant validators. Required unavailable checks remain blocked.
- **Actual local behavior.** Run the affected endpoint, CLI, integration, or UI flow; use available browser/computer capabilities when needed.
- **Progressive disclosure.** Load the current skill and needed references. Workers get bounded criteria and source pointers, with a 500-word input and 200-word return target.

---

## Validation and Evals

The repository checks structure, command parity, links, and lexical routing without model calls:

```bash
node scripts/validate-skills.js
node scripts/validate-reference-links.js
node scripts/validate-commands.js
node scripts/run-evals.js --min-rank1 95
```

There are 65 behavioral scenarios across 26 skill case files, with runnable fixtures and optional Claude/Codex execution. Lexical ranking tests vocabulary within this catalog; it does not prove natural model activation or priority against another plugin. Behavioral dry-runs validate inputs without running a model. Actual model traces, tests, and runtime artifacts establish compliance. See the [eval guide](evals/README.md) and [change report](docs/sdlc-workflow-report.md).

---

## Project Structure

The portable core stays in shared directories. Host-specific paths are native discovery conventions, not branding aliases; renaming or merging them would break the tools that scan those exact locations.

| Layer / consumer | Repository paths | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Shared workflow core | `skills/` (26 skills) | Portable `SKILL.md` workflows used by every integration |
| Shared review material | `agents/` (4 personas), `references/` (9 documents) | Specialist reviewers, workflow contracts, and pack-level checklists |
| Claude Code adapter | `.claude/commands/` (9 commands), `.claude-plugin/`, `hooks/` | Slash-command wrappers, marketplace metadata, and lifecycle hooks |
| Gemini CLI adapter | `.gemini/commands/` (9 commands) | Gemini-native TOML command wrappers |
| Antigravity CLI adapter | `commands/` (9 commands), `plugin.json` | Legacy TOML wrappers and the root plugin manifest; see the [known wrapper limitation](docs/antigravity-setup.md#lifecycle-workflows-and-command-compatibility) |
| Codex adapter | `.codex-plugin/`, `.agents/plugins/` | Codex plugin metadata and marketplace registration; Codex consumes `skills/` directly |
| GitHub Copilot CLI adapter | `plugin.json` | Root plugin metadata; Copilot CLI discovers `skills/` by convention and does not register the lifecycle wrappers |
| Contributor tooling | `scripts/`, `evals/` (26 case files), `.github/workflows/` | Validation, installation, routing evals, and CI |
| Documentation | `docs/` | Universal guidance and per-tool setup guides |

Tools without a checked-in adapter directory install or copy the shared `skills/` core into their own native location. The [Quick Start](#quick-start) links the setup guide for each supported host.

## Why e6-agent-skills?

AI coding agents can skip specs, tests, security reviews, and the practices that make software reliable. e6-agent-skills gives agents explicit workflow steps and evidence gates drawn from production engineering practice. Host wiring improves activation; actual model compliance still needs evaluation.

Each skill encodes hard-won engineering judgment: *when* to write a spec, *what* to test, *how* to review, and *when* to ship. These aren't generic prompts - they're the kind of opinionated, process-driven workflows that separate production-quality work from prototype-quality work.

Skills bake in best practices from Google's engineering culture — including concepts from [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book) and Google's [engineering practices guide](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/). You'll find Hyrum's Law in API design, the Beyonce Rule and test pyramid in testing, change sizing and review speed norms in code review, Chesterton's Fence in simplification, trunk-based development in git workflow, Shift Left and feature flags in CI/CD, and a dedicated deprecation skill treating code as a liability. These aren't abstract principles — they're embedded directly into the step-by-step workflows agents follow.

---

## How it compares

See the [workflow design sources](docs/workflow-design-sources.md) for patterns adapted from Compound Engineering, Superpowers, ADHD, and Caveman, with inspected revisions and licenses. The [comparison guide](docs/comparison.md) provides background on other skill packs; its external single-task experiment does not measure these latest changes.

---

## Contributing

Skills should be **specific** (actionable steps, not vague advice), **verifiable** (clear exit criteria with evidence requirements), **battle-tested** (based on real workflows), and **minimal** (only what's needed to guide the agent).

See [docs/skill-anatomy.md](docs/skill-anatomy.md) for the format specification and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.
