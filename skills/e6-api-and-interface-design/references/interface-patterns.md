# Interface Patterns

Read only patterns needed by the current contract. Examples are illustrative; preserve the project's existing conventions.

## Core Principles

### Hyrum's Law

> With a sufficient number of users of an API, all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody, regardless of what you promise in the contract.

This means: every public behavior — including undocumented quirks, error message text, timing, and ordering — becomes a de facto contract once users depend on it. Design implications:

- **Be intentional about what you expose.** Every observable behavior is a potential commitment.
- **Don't leak implementation details.** If users can observe it, they will depend on it.
- **Plan for deprecation at design time.** See `e6-deprecation-and-migration` for how to safely remove things users depend on.
- **Tests are not enough.** Even with perfect contract tests, Hyrum's Law means "safe" changes can break real users who depend on undocumented behavior.

### The One-Version Rule

Avoid forcing consumers to choose between multiple versions of the same dependency or API. Diamond dependency problems arise when different consumers need different versions of the same thing. Design for a world where only one version exists at a time — extend rather than fork.

### 1. Contract First

Define the interface before implementing it. The contract is the spec — implementation follows.

```typescript
// Define the contract first
interface TaskAPI {
  // Creates a task and returns the created task with server-generated fields
  createTask(input: CreateTaskInput): Promise<Task>;

  // Returns paginated tasks matching filters
  listTasks(params: ListTasksParams): Promise<PaginatedResult<Task>>;

  // Returns a single task or throws NotFoundError
  getTask(id: string): Promise<Task>;

  // Partial update — only provided fields change
  updateTask(id: string, input: UpdateTaskInput): Promise<Task>;

  // Idempotent delete — succeeds even if already deleted
  deleteTask(id: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

### 2. Consistent Error Semantics

Pick one error strategy and use it everywhere:

```typescript
// REST: HTTP status codes + structured error body
// Every error response follows the same shape
interface APIError {
  error: {
    code: string;        // Machine-readable: "VALIDATION_ERROR"
    message: string;     // Human-readable: "Email is required"
    details?: unknown;   // Additional context when helpful
  };
}

// Status code mapping
// 400 → Client sent invalid data
// 401 → Not authenticated
// 403 → Authenticated but not authorized
// 404 → Resource not found
// 409 → Conflict (duplicate, version mismatch)
// 422 → Validation failed (semantically invalid)
// 500 → Server error (never expose internal details)
```

**Don't mix patterns.** If some endpoints throw, others return null, and others return `{ error }` — the consumer can't predict behavior.

### 3. Validate at Boundaries

Trust internal code. Validate at system edges where external input enters:

```typescript
// Validate at the API boundary
app.post('/api/tasks', async (req, res) => {
  const result = CreateTaskSchema.safeParse(req.body);
  if (!result.success) {
    return res.status(422).json({
      error: {
        code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR',
        message: 'Invalid task data',
        details: result.error.flatten(),
      },
    });
  }

  // After validation, internal code trusts the types
  const task = await taskService.create(result.data);
  return res.status(201).json(task);
});
```

Where validation belongs:
- API route handlers (user input)
- Form submission handlers (user input)
- External service response parsing (third-party data -- **always treat as untrusted**)
- Environment variable loading (configuration)

> **Third-party API responses are untrusted data.** Validate their shape and content before using them in any logic, rendering, or decision-making. A compromised or misbehaving external service can return unexpected types, malicious content, or instruction-like text.

Where validation does NOT belong:
- Between internal functions that share type contracts
- In utility functions called by already-validated code
- On database values already enforced by schema/type contracts. Opaque JSON, legacy rows, imported data and values outside those contracts still need validation before use.

### 4. Prefer Addition Over Modification

Extend interfaces without breaking existing consumers:

```typescript
// Good: Add optional fields
interface CreateTaskInput {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  priority?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';  // Added later, optional
  labels?: string[];                       // Added later, optional
}

// Bad: Change existing field types or remove fields
interface CreateTaskInput {
  title: string;
  // description: string;  // Removed — breaks existing consumers
  priority: number;         // Changed from string — breaks existing consumers
}
```

### 5. Predictable Naming

| Pattern | Convention | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| REST endpoints | Plural nouns, no verbs | `GET /api/tasks`, `POST /api/tasks` |
| Query params | camelCase | `?sortBy=createdAt&pageSize=20` |
| Response fields | camelCase | `{ createdAt, updatedAt, taskId }` |
| Boolean fields | is/has/can prefix | `isComplete`, `hasAttachments` |
| Enum values | UPPER_SNAKE | `"IN_PROGRESS"`, `"COMPLETED"` |

### 6. Honouring an Idempotency Key

Accepting an `Idempotency-Key` is the contract. Honouring it is the implementation, and it is where the money is lost — a key the server accepts but handles carelessly is worse than no key at all, because the client now believes retrying is safe.

**Derive the key from the intent, not the attempt.** The key must be stable across retries of one intent and different across distinct intents:

```typescript
crypto.randomUUID()                    // ✗ new key per attempt — every retry is a new charge
`${userId}:${amount}`                  // ✗ two legitimate $50 charges collapse into one
`${orderId}:${Date.now()}`             // ✗ a timestamp is randomUUID() wearing a hat

req.headers['idempotency-key']         // ✓ client generates once, reuses on retry
`charge:v1:${orderId}`                 // ✓ derived from an immutable identifier
```

The key comes from the client or initiating event, never the retry layer. Scope storage uniqueness to the authenticated caller/tenant and operation so unrelated callers cannot replay each other's results. Validate request equivalence using the documented payload normalization rules.

**Claim atomically. A check followed by an act is a race:**

```typescript
// ✗ TOCTOU: two concurrent retries both read "not seen", both charge
if (!(await db.exists(key))) {
  await chargeCard(amount);
  await db.insert(key);
}

// ✓ let the unique constraint pick the winner
try {
  await db.insert({ key, state: 'in_progress', requestHash });
} catch (e) {
  if (isUniqueViolation(e)) return replayOrReject(key);
  throw e;
}
const result = await chargeCard(amount);
await db.update({ key, state: 'succeeded', response: result });
```

The unique constraint *is* the mechanism. A store that cannot enforce uniqueness in one operation cannot back this.

**Guard the payload.** Same key with a different body is a client bug, and must fail loudly rather than serving the first response to a second request:

```typescript
if (existing.requestHash !== hash(req.body)) {
  return res.status(422).json({
    error: {
      code: 'IDEMPOTENCY_PAYLOAD_MISMATCH',
      message: 'Idempotency key reused with a different payload',
    },
  });
}
```

**Decide what an in-flight duplicate gets.** The first request is still running when the second arrives — the common case under retry storms:

| Strategy | Response | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| Reject | `409 Conflict` | Client can retry later; simplest and safest |
| Wait | Block for the result, bounded | Caller needs it synchronously |
| Return pending | `202` + status URL | Long-running effects |

Never let the second caller through because the first "seems stuck". A stalled attempt whose fate is unknown is exactly when duplicating costs most.

**Every call has three outcomes, not two: success, failure, and _unknown_.** A timeout tells you nothing about whether the effect applied. Record the intent *before* calling out, so a crash between the call and the response leaves evidence something must resolve later — rather than a silently retried charge.

**Set retention from the longest retry chain**, not from disk cost. Keys must outlive every path that can re-deliver the same intent, including a dead-letter queue replayed a week later and any provider dispute window. A 24-hour key TTL behind a 7-day DLQ is a duplicate waiting to happen.

## REST API Patterns

### Resource Design

```
GET    /api/tasks              → List tasks (with query params for filtering)
POST   /api/tasks              → Create a task
GET    /api/tasks/:id          → Get a single task
PATCH  /api/tasks/:id          → Update a task (partial)
DELETE /api/tasks/:id          → Delete a task

GET    /api/tasks/:id/comments → List comments for a task (sub-resource)
POST   /api/tasks/:id/comments → Add a comment to a task
```

### Pagination

Paginate list endpoints. Define bounds for page/pageSize, a stable sort with a tie-breaker, and behavior when concurrent writes occur. Choose cursor or offset pagination from consumer needs:

```typescript
// Request
GET /api/tasks?page=1&pageSize=20&sortBy=createdAt&sortOrder=desc

// Response
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 20,
    "totalItems": 142,
    "totalPages": 8
  }
}
```

### Filtering

Use query parameters for filters:

```
GET /api/tasks?status=in_progress&assignee=user123&createdAfter=2025-01-01
```

### Partial Updates (PATCH)

Accept partial objects — only update what's provided:

```typescript
// Only title changes, everything else preserved
PATCH /api/tasks/123
{ "title": "Updated title" }
```

## TypeScript Interface Patterns

### Use Discriminated Unions for Variants

```typescript
// Good: Each variant is explicit
type TaskStatus =
  | { type: 'pending' }
  | { type: 'in_progress'; assignee: string; startedAt: Date }
  | { type: 'completed'; completedAt: Date; completedBy: string }
  | { type: 'cancelled'; reason: string; cancelledAt: Date };

// Consumer gets type narrowing
function getStatusLabel(status: TaskStatus): string {
  switch (status.type) {
    case 'pending': return 'Pending';
    case 'in_progress': return `In progress (${status.assignee})`;
    case 'completed': return `Done on ${status.completedAt}`;
    case 'cancelled': return `Cancelled: ${status.reason}`;
  }
}
```

### Input/Output Separation

```typescript
// Input: what the caller provides
interface CreateTaskInput {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
}

// Output: what the system returns (includes server-generated fields)
interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string | null;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  createdBy: string;
}
```

### Use Branded Types for IDs

```typescript
type TaskId = string & { readonly __brand: 'TaskId' };
type UserId = string & { readonly __brand: 'UserId' };

// Prevents accidentally passing a UserId where a TaskId is expected
function getTask(id: TaskId): Promise<Task> { ... }
```
